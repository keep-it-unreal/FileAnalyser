While XML files can be imported individually via the user interface (see: Import XML), it may be desireable to import multiple XML files through the command line. The import:bulk command-line task can be used to import the following types of XML data:

MODS and EAD 2002 (for archival description data)
SKOS RDF XML (for term data import into a taxonomy)
EAC-CPF XML (for authority record data)
The primary documentation on preparing for XML imports, and on how matching behavior is handled for some of the import options, is maintained in the User Manual. See:
